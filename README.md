# Simon Caldwell’s Sunset Radio



I love Simon Caldwell’s [*Sunset* radio show](https://fbiradio.com/945fm/programs/sunset-simon-caldwell/), but FBI’s website is a pain to navigate. This little project aims to make my life easier by creating a sort of collection of his shows. Progress will be reported on my [blog](https://www.vinceth.net/docs/blog.html).

## Tools

I’ll be using R and various packages.
